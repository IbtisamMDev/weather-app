# Weather App üå¶Ô∏è

A simple weather app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather data.

## Features

- Displays temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, and an icon.
- Changes background image dynamically based on the searched city.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) to get a free API key.
3. Open the `script.js` file and replace the placeholder `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual API key:
   ```javascript
   apikey: "your_actual_api_key";
